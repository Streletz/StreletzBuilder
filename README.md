# StreletzBuilder

The program for the Assembly .NET projects with the ability to update their source code from a remote Git repository.

In fact, this program is only a graphical interface for the git and dotnet console commands and was written exclusively in "for the love of art".

The program is open source and distributed free of charge.

System requirements:

 - Windows 10;
 - Git 2.17.0 or higher;
 - Microsoft Visual Studio Build Tools 2019 or higher;
 - .NET Core 3.1 (to build the program itself).
 
 ## Whats new
 
  - Supporting MSBuild and .NET Framework;

 Also, starting from this version, the installer project is excluded from the source code. ClickOnce is now used instead.
